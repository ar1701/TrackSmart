**TrackSmart** is an open-source platform revolutionizing the logistics landscape in India. Built on the BECKN protocol, it offers unified, real-time shipment tracking across carriers and transport modes—bringing transparency, predictive insights, and operational efficiency to e-commerce and small businesses, especially in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.

## **Project Overview**

### **Redefining Logistics Visibility for India’s Emerging Markets**  
Logistics tracking in India remains fragmented and siloed across multiple carriers—leaving sellers, customers, and delivery partners in the dark. TrackSmart changes that by leveraging the **BECKN protocol** and modern APIs, we deliver a seamless, end-to-end tracking solution that’s accessible, predictive, and open to all.

From small-town sellers to last-mile carriers, TrackSmart brings everyone onto a unified logistics platform, enabling **transparency**, reducing failed deliveries, and fostering inclusive digital growth in **underserved regions**.

## **Inspiration**

Imagine you’ve shipped a product from Bihar to Bengaluru. After pickup, there’s no trace of its journey until delivery. Now multiply that frustration across millions of sellers and e-commerce customers—especially in regions where delivery issues can break trust.

We were inspired by this broken experience—where:

Sellers chase multiple portals to know where a shipment is.

Customers are left clueless about delays or handovers.

Carriers lack ecosystem integration to scale efficiently.

TrackSmart brings a modern, transparent, and API-first solution to this outdated model—built not for a few tech giants, but for every logistic stakeholder in the country.
