### Step 5: Test Different Scenarios

#### Scenario A: No Available Providers

- Create shipment from pincode `700001` (Kolkata) to `110001` (Delhi)
- Should show "No providers available" message

#### Scenario B: Large Shipment Filtering

- Create shipment with weight `60` kg and dimensions `150x150x150` cm
- Should only show providers that can handle large shipments

#### Scenario C: Local Delivery

- Create shipment from `110001` to `110002` (both Delhi)
- Should show local delivery options with faster delivery times

## Provider Dashboard Testing (Future Step):

Once shipment requests are created, test the provider dashboard:

1. Login as a provider (to be implemented)
2. View incoming shipment requests
3. Accept/reject requests
4. Update shipment status

## API Endpoints Available:

- `GET /seller/quotes/:shipmentId` - Get quotes for a shipment
- `POST /seller/quotes/:shipmentId/refresh` - Refresh quotes
- `POST /seller/quotes/:shipmentId/select` - Select a provider
- `GET /provider/requests` - Get shipment requests for provider
- `POST /provider/requests/:requestId/accept` - Accept a request
- `POST /provider/requests/:requestId/reject` - Reject a request

## Database Collections:

- `providers` - Provider information
- `providerquotes` - Quote data
- `shipmentrequests` - Provider selection requests
- `shipments` - Shipment data
- `sellers` - Seller accounts

## Testing Tips:

1. **Use browser developer tools** to monitor API calls during testing
2. **Check MongoDB Atlas** to verify data is being saved correctly
3. **Test different pincode combinations** to verify filtering logic
4. **Try edge cases** like very heavy or large shipments
5. **Verify error handling** for unsupported routes
