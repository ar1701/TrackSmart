# Provider Dashboard Fixes - COMPLETE âœ…

## Summary

All three issues in the provider dashboard have been successfully fixed and tested.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Show Correct Amount for Requests

**Problem**: Provider dashboard was showing different amounts than what was originally shown to seller.

**Solution**: Updated the cost display logic in `dashboard.ejs` to prioritize the estimated cost from the quote:

```javascript
â‚¹<%= (request.quoteId?.estimatedCost || request.requestedCost || 0).toLocaleString() %>
```

**Files Modified**:

- `views/providerPage/dashboard.ejs` - Line 329

### 2. âœ… Fix Accept Request Button Functionality

**Problem**: Accept request button was not working due to incorrect API endpoint URLs.

**Solution**:

- Fixed JavaScript fetch URLs from `/provider/requests/` to `/api/providers/requests/`
- Updated route mounting in `app.js` from `/api` to `/api/providers`
- Fixed authentication middleware to use session-based authentication instead of passport

**Files Modified**:

- `views/providerPage/dashboard.ejs` - JavaScript fetch URLs (Lines ~463, ~513)
- `app.js` - Route mounting (Line 95)
- `routes/providerRoutes.js` - Authentication middleware (Lines 60-85)

### 3. âœ… Add Status Update Functionality for Accepted Requests

**Solution**: Implemented complete status update functionality:

#### Frontend Changes:

#### Backend Changes:

- Enhanced shipment model with:

  - `statusHistory` field for tracking all status changes
  - Automatic status history middleware

**Files Modified**:

- `routes/providerRoutes.js` - Added status update route
- `controllers/providerController.js` - Added updateShipmentStatus function
